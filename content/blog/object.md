The object that represents me the most is my favorite reverse engineering tool, Ghidra, developed by the National Security Agency. What I find relatable is how it's able to process and reconstruct something foreign and unknown in it's own way, just like how I try to break apart and try to understand through my own vision things I don't understand. Additionally, much like the open source nature and continuous support, there is more room to grow, just like me, where I have more room to grow and develop as a person.
