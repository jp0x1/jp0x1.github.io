# Background Info

I'm Jake Park and I'm applying to college. I'm here to clear up stuff about one of the most difficult parts of the college applications process: Standing Out.

## Introduction

It’s finally happening. You’ve been in high school for the past three years and now that ominous cloud called “College” is fast approaching. But you've been preparing haven’t you? With that high GPA and SAT, plus a little extracurriculars sprinkled in, surely you can get into your dream school right? Unfortunately it’s not that simple. As someone who is currently applying to college and dealing with the process firsthand, I’d like to share some thoughts as well as research into the more “open-ended” aspects of the college application process.  

## What Do These Colleges Want?

So what are colleges looking for? Elite institutions such as the ivy league don’t care if you have a high GPA or SAT. Everybody who applies there basically has the same “stats”. Instead, what colleges are looking for is someone unique, someone with potential. Malcolm Gladwell, author of “[Getting In](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KPUQfT48xivNLst2db_fAEIOfIQwVHQT/view)”, suggests that colleges like Harvard essentially want “superstars” rather than relatively successful graduates. Think of these people as students that end up being a CEO of a hot startup, a big name actor, or an influential politician. The desire to search for these “superstars” colleges believe that, as Gladwell describes,  “Non-intellective factors” such as motivation and social skills matter more in determining whether someone should be admitted into a college. 

## How do I show that I'm a superstar?

So how can I prove to colleges that I’m so special and outstanding? To answer that, let’s look at a factor of the college admissions process that is becoming ever more important year by year: the personal statement. In “[The Rhetoric of College Application Essays: Removing Obstacles for Low Income and Minority Students](https://drive.google.com/file/d/13DgW2wfUJJj7aM2wyFaZPh-e7RNjiZn5/view)”, James Warren defines the personal statement as “persuasive argument masquerading as personal narrative.” The personal statement in its most basic form is an argument to the college on why they should accept you, rather than some random. However, the open ended-ness of the personal statement can lead some confused on how they can even create an argument from a narrative. Warren recommends the reader to “teach their students to tailor their essays to the specific expectations of particular institutions.” Essentially Warren recommends that we need to “sell” our image to a college rather than convey who we are. 

I found this information particularly useful in writing my personal statement. As someone who dislikes open-ended questions, I felt confused by the goal of the personal statement. However, by framing the essay as a narrative with a subliminal message of persuasion, I felt it cleared a lot up on finding an idea as well as writing the essay in a way that aligns to what colleges would probably want.

## Diversity?

Ok, so you now know the goal of the personal statement, but we should discuss a core facet of the college admissions process that is intertwined with the personal statement. This big, perhaps controversial, aspect of the college admissions process is: diversity. Ok, ok put the pitchforks down. Initially when you thought of diversity you thought about maybe something like race right? Many Americans also believe in that definition of diversity too. However, according to Kirkland and Hensen in "[How Do I Bring Diversity?](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QX5SgkOGGsNlBkV7vSRVL-BJeMW1rY9K/view)"diversity encompasses a much larger range of topics than solely race, religion, etc. Essentially students should see questions on diversity as more of a question of their individual strengths, and should feel free to define their diversity in untraditional ways such as their passions or quirks.

As someone who fits a common stereotype (Asian male in computer-related field), I had doubts on whether I could prove why colleges should accept me due to what I thought of as my “lack of uniqueness”. As of now, I’ve come to realize that there’s a lot more to me than just “Asian male in computer science”, such as my obsession with cybersecurity, passion for the niche field of reverse engineering, designs of towns and cities, and my love of walking outside. 

## Conclusion

With all this talk of “diversity” and “uniqueness”, it can feel as if you are receiving a raffle number when you submit your college application, as unlike a simple test score, your unique traits might not immediately translate towards a defined line between acceptance or rejection. However, my recommendation is to just relax, and appreciate what you’ve done already. Focus on what you love to do, and try to be really good at it. Show to colleges that you have the potential to be a superstar. Remember to still stay on top of your schoolwork and get a good score on the SAT (those still matter). As long as you remain focused and happy throughout the journey, everything will probably be alright.
