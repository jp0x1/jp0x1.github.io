# Background Information

I know ZERO FPGA stuff or like hardware stuff. I want to, but I'm stupid af. I need to learn some kind of hardware description language so I decided to go through this verilog exercises site. This post is just going through the verilog basics.

## Basics

### Simple wire

> Verilog wires are directional and flow in one direction, from source to sink. 
> Verilog "continuous assignment" is `assign left_side = right_side;` as the value of the signal of the right is driven to the wire on the left.
> Ports have a direction (input or output). Input is driven by something from outside the module, while output drives something outside.

```verilog
module top_module( input in, output out );
	assign out = in;
endmodule
```

### Four Wires

> For multiple assign statements, order in which they appear does not matter. 
> Assign statements describe connections between things, not copying values from one thing to another

```verilog
module top_module( 
    input a,b,c,
    output w,x,y,z );
	assign w = a;
    assign x = b;
    assign y = b;
    assign z = c;
endmodule
```

### Inverter

> An inverter is a NOT gate

```verilog
module top_module( input in, output out );
 assign out = ~in;
endmodule
```

### AND gate

> An AND gate has two inputs, and drives out the AND of the signals a and b.
> "driven" just means "has a known value by something attached to it"

```verilog
module top_module( 
    input a, 
    input b, 
    output out );
	assign out = a & b;
endmodule
```

### NOR gate

> NOR gate is an OR gate with its output inverted.
> NOR function needs two operators when written in verilog.

```verilog
module top_module( input a, input b, output out );
    assign out = !(a | b);
endmodule
```

### XNOR gate

> XNOR is just inverted XOR gate.

```verilog
assign out = !(a ^ b);
```

### Declaring Wires

> Need wires to connect internal components together.
> When need to use wire, should declare it in the body of the module, somewhere before it is used
> Basics use signal of type `wire`

```verilog
`default_nettype none
module top_module(
    input a,
    input b,
    input c,
    input d,
    output out,
    output out_n   ); 
    wire wireab = a & b;
    wire wirecd = c & d;
    wire wireabcd = !(wireab | wirecd);
    assign out = !(wireabcd);
    assign out_n = (wireabcd);
endmodule
```

### 7458 chip

> 7458 is a chip with four AND and two OR gates.

```verilog
module top_module ( 
    input p1a, p1b, p1c, p1d, p1e, p1f,
    output p1y,
    input p2a, p2b, p2c, p2d,
    output p2y );
	
    wire p1abc = (p1a & p1b & p1c);
    wire p1fed = (p1f & p1e & p1d);
    wire p2ab = (p2a & p2b);
    wire p2cd = (p2c & p2d);
    
    assign p1y = p1abc | p1fed;
    assign p2y = p2ab | p2cd;

endmodule
```

## Vectors

### Vectors

> Vectors are used to group related signals using one name to make it more convenient to manipulate. For example, wire [7:0] w; declares an 8-bit vector named w that is functionally equivalent to having 8 separate wires.
> Notice that the declaration of a vector places the dimensions before the name of the vector, which is unusual compared to C syntax. However, the part select has the dimensions after the vector name as you would expect.

```verilog
module top_module ( 
    input wire [2:0] vec,
    output wire [2:0] outv,
    output wire o2,
    output wire o1,
    output wire o0  ); // Module body starts after module declaration
    assign o0 = vec[0]; 
    assign o1 = vec[1]; 
    assign o2 = vec[2];
    assign outv = vec;
endmodule
```
